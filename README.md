# DnDDungeonCrawler
This little programm lets you create tilebased dungeons for your TTRPG.
I have used the Stone Assets of [Adventurica's](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/840112518/dungeon-builders-toolkit-modular-maps-for-ttrpgs-and-dandd/creator_bio) [Dungeon Builders Toolkit](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/840112518/dungeon-builders-toolkit-modular-maps-for-ttrpgs-and-dandd/description) but you can use any images you want, as long as they are in a 1:1 ratio ;)

## Features
There is a editmode with a minimap and some more info on how to use this programm. If you turn it off, the minimap and info will also disappear and the programm will start in fullscreen. If you are not in editmode, you can't move past existing tiles. In editmode to create a new tile, simply move to a free space. The red square on the minimap is you and the green one is your staring point which you can't delete. You can save and load your dungeons too!
